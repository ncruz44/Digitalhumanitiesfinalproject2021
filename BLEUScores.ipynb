    "news_translation=[\"North Korea announced that it would not participate in the Tokyo Olympic Games in July due to COVID-19. The latest announcement practically put a stop to the Moon Jae-in government’s plan to use the upcoming Olympics as an opportunity to resume the process for peace on the Korean Peninsula. According to Sports in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea--a website run by North Korea’s sports ministry--on April 6, North Korea’s Olympic Committee held a general meeting and decided not to take part in the 32nd Olympic Games in order to protect our athletes from the global health crisis caused by the malicious virus infection. The meeting was held on March 25, which was also the day North Korea launched a ballistic missile. This is the first time that North Korea will skip the Summer Olympics since it took part in the 1988 Seoul Olympics 33 years ago. North Korea closed off its borders and focused on blocking the novel coronavirus since the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak last February. It appears the North, which has a poor medical system, decided to bow out of the Olympics to prevent the virus from entering the country through its athletes. North Korea’s decision to skip the Tokyo Olympics will make it harder for President Moon to find a breakthrough in inter-Korean relations during his remaining term in office. In his speech during a ceremony commemorating the March 1 Independence Movement last month, President Moon said, 'The Tokyo Olympics can be an opportunity for dialogue between South Korea and Japan, between the two Koreas, between North Korea and Japan, and between North Korea and the United States.' An official from the Ministry of Unification said, 'We had hoped the upcoming Olympics to provide an opportunity for progress in peace on the Korean Peninsula and in reconciliation and cooperation between the two Koreas, but we are sorry that things cannot proceed as expected due to COVID-19.' He expressed regrets on the latest decision, which pulled the brakes on the government’s plan to take advantage of the Tokyo Olympics for dialogue on the Korean Peninsula. The announcement also disrupted the Japanese government’s expectations to make the Tokyo Olympics into another successful 'Pyeongchang Olympics.' Last month, when North Korea launched the ballistic missile, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said that if Kim Yo-jong, a vice director of the Workers’ Party of Korea, visited Japan during the Tokyo Olympics, 'If it helps resolve the issue of kidnappings, It is my job to resolve it' and left the door open for dialogue. This is why some experts claim that North Korea’s decision to skip the Olympics was a political decision reflecting the deteriorating relationship between North Korea and Japan. However, some suggest that we should wait and see if the decision to bow out of the Olympics released on the sports ministry website is the final decision by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The government observed that the decision was not covered by North Korean state media, such as the Korea Central News Agency, and believed there was a need for further investigation to see if the latest announcement was based on a decision at the highest level. The International Olympic Committee said that it did not receive any official application from the North Korean Olympic Committee about the decision not to take part in the Tokyo Olympics\"]\n",

However, some say that the decision to boycott the Olympics, which was made on the website of the Ministry of Sports, should be seen whether Kim Jong-un's decision was the final decision.

    "business_reference_translation=[\"On February 6, the Seoul Central District Court sentenced a fine of 26 billion won to Audi Volkswagen Korea and 1-2 years in prison and a stay of execution for former executives at the company for violating the Clean Air Conservation Act. They were charged with importing 120,000 diesel vehicles with manipulated exhaust reduction systems, which released levels of NOx that exceeded standards and selling most of the imported cars. We find the amount of the fine and the severity of the punishment light when compared to the crime committed. Former president Park, who received a prison sentence was not detained during the trial, and the sentencing of Johannes Thammer, the former managing director who fled to Germany, was postponed. The actions of Audi Volkswagen Korea were a serious crime for it was an intentional manipulation that inflicted harm on the environment. The NOx released by diesel vehicles are deadly to the human body. They include nitrogen monoxide, a group-1 carcinogen known to cause lung cancer. South Korea manages NOx levels according to the European standards for vehicle exhaust. In the case of passenger vehicles, the standard was Euro5 (0.18g/km) and Euro6 (0.08g/km) before and after September 2018, respectively. But when driven, the Audi Volkswagen vehicles with manipulated exhaust controls released NOx at levels nearly ten times that of Euro5. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the automaker carried out an act of gas terrorism against the South Korean people. What’s more, Audi Volkswagen Korea was aware of this fact, but chose to conceal it. The judges pointed out that former president Park and the executives were fully aware of relevant legislation, but did not abide by the law. The exhaust reduction controls worked normally during the inspection, but the company manipulated the controls so that they would not burden the vehicle during actual driving. They tried to maintain the performance of the vehicle, such as mileage and power, which fell when the exhaust controls worked normally during driving. In the end, the company turned a blind eye to air pollution to make more money. The court also criticized, The defendants only concentrated on maximizing profits. The government’s responsibility was not light, either. The number of diesel vehicles in this country reached 24 million--42% of all registered cars--but the government only implemented a policy to manage the exhaust of vehicles including compact cars just two years ago. The regulations on the punishment for environmental regulation violations are as loose as can be, and certification inspections are mostly conducted in writing. Greta Thunberg, a teen environmental activist spoke before the United Nations last year and said, We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth, and added, If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. The government and Audi Volkswagen Korea should take this opportunity and look back on themselves and see if they were not “evil” with their eyes closed to the pollution of the Earth.\"]\n",

It is suspected of operating an exhaust gas reduction device and ordering 120,000 diesel vehicles that emit nitrogen oxides (NOx) exceeding the standard, and selling a considerable amount of them. It is unfortunate that the fines and sentences are light compared to the crimes committed. Former President Park Mo and others, who were sentenced to imprisonment, escaped legal custody, and the sentence was postponed for former general manager Johannes Tamer, who fled to Germany. AVK's actions are heavy in that they are environmental crimes by intentional manipulation. Nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel vehicles are fatal to the human body. It exhales nitrogen monoxide, a first-class carcinogen that causes lung cancer. In Korea, nitrogen oxides are managed by the European emission standard (euro). For passenger cars, Euro 5 (0.18g/km) was applied until September 2015, and Euro 6 (0.08g/km) was applied thereafter. However, it is said that AVK emission-operated vehicles have almost 10 times more nitrogen oxide emissions than the Euro 5 standard when driving. It is not an exaggeration to say that he committed a gas terror against the Korean people. Moreover, AVK hid it even though it knew it. The judiciary pointed out that Park, etc., did not comply with the relevant laws even though they fully recognized the related laws. The exhaust gas reduction device was operated at a level that normally operates during inspection and does not burden the vehicle during actual driving. If the reduction device operates normally while driving, it is to prevent the deterioration of performance such as fuel economy and output, but in the end, he closed his eyes on air pollution in order to make money. The defendants focused only on maximizing their profits, the judge criticized. The government's responsibility is also not small. Diesel vehicles account for 42% of the 24 million registered vehicles, but it was only two years ago that the emission control system, including small cars, took effect.

    "entertainment_reference_translation=[\"The summer stage in the Korean music industry is usually dominated by girl groups. The girl groups armed with fresh and bubbly music and cool costumes bearing a lot of skin are consumed by the public as typical cultural products to blast away the heat. Also bands that are relatively less popular and debuting bands mostly target the summer stage to promote themselves. This year, a battle of girl groups has been announced ahead of the summer heat. However, unlike previous years, this year, top girl groups with a solid fan base will be clashing head on. Girls' Generation will take to the stage followed by Sistar (photo), A-Pink, Girl's Day, AOA, Nine Muses, Mamamoo, etc. We give you some pointers on what to look forward to to more fully enjoy the comeback stages and activities of these groups. The first summer comeback in six years for the Girls' Generation: In June 2009, the song that these girls sang on stage in white sailor suits while dancing like they were kicking jegi was Tell Me Your Wish. It was an upbeat euro dance number which went on to become a mega hit along with the slim figures of the girls. The song was a consecutive home run following Gee released earlier and it secured the top position among girl groups for the Girls' Generation. No other song released by the Girls' Generation afterwards had as powerful an impact as this song. The Girls' Generation usually released their new singles at the start of the year or in the fall, but this time they have changed strategies and are taking the summer stage for the first time in six years. What's more, it is the first stage with only eight members since Jessica left the group. What kind of synergy will their music and fashion create this time Sistar: Will they continue their invincible streak in the summer? Sistar is recognized as a top star in online music sharing and downloads. The songs they have released every summer since 2011 have all topped the music charts. Starting with So Cool, followed by Loving U (2012), Give It To Me (2013), and Touch My Body (2014), not a single song has flopped. This is why all eyes and ears are on the new number by Sistar which will be released on June 22. A competition with Big Bang, dominating the charts for the second month, is also a topic of interest. Solo acts and appearances in variety shows: what kind of effect will they have? A-Pink, Girl's Day, and AOA are girl groups that have become popular in recent years. They succeeded in coming up with a concept different from the existing flood of girl groups. In addition, the solo activities of the members also contributed to the popularity of the group as a whole. A-Pink was able to secure their fans earlier due to the works of Jung Eun-ji, and they were followed by Girl's Day and AOA. Girl's Day's Hye-ri in the TV show, The Real Men, So-jin in Mystery Music Show: Mask King, and Yu-ra in Just Married and AOA's Ji-min in Unpretty Rap Star, Cho-a in My Little Television, and Seol-hyun in Orange Marmalade have attracted the spotlight this past year. AOA will release their new single on June 22 and Girl's Day and A-Pink are scheduled to release their new singles next month.\"]\n",

    "entertainment_google_translation=\"In the summer stage of the music industry, girl groups have usually been fighting. This is because a girl group armed with cool exposed clothing and music with a fresh and lively concept is consumed by the public as a representative cultural product to blow off the heat. Groups and rookie teams with relatively low recognition often use the summer stage as an active path. Competition for girl groups is predicted this year, ahead of the full-fledged heat season. What's different from previous years is that they even go out to top-notch girl groups with a solid fandom. Starting with Girls' Generation, Sistar (photo), A Pink, Girl's Day, AOA, Nine Muses, and Mamamoo will be on the stage. Here's a summary of the points to enjoy their comeback and activities in a more fun way. Girls' Generation's Summer Comeback in 6 Years In June 2009, they stood on the stage in white sailor uniforms and performed Jegi-kicki dance and the song they sang was Tell Me Your Wish. This cheerful Eurodance-style song recorded an unprecedented hit with the cool legs of the members. After hitting a home run in the batters following the previously announced ‘지’, Girls’ Generation sat in the seat of the best girl group. None of the songs from Girls' Generation that have been released since then have resonated like this. They change their strategy of releasing new songs in the beginning of the year or autumn, and challenge the summer stage in six years. In addition, it is the first stage to be presented as an eight-person system after Jessica withdrawal. What kind of synergy will the music and fashion they will show? SISTAR, will it continue to be unbeaten in the summer? SISTAR is the best sound source powerhouse that is self-proclaimed. Every summer since 2011, their new songs have topped the charts every time. From'So Cool' to'Loving You' (2012),'Give It To Me' (2013), and'Touch My Body' (2014), there has never been a failure. This is why SISTAR's new song to be released on the 22nd is drawing attention. The confrontation with Big Bang, which has been on the top of the chart for the second month, is also interesting. What will the effect of entertainment and personal activities? The girl groups that have emerged rapidly in recent years are Apink, Girl's Day, and AOA. It was effective to put up a differentiated concept amid the flood of girl groups. In addition, the individual members' activities have contributed to the rise of the team's awareness. If Apink has settled earlier with Jung Eun-ji's performance, then Girl's Day and AOA will follow. Girl's Day's Hye-ri (real man), So-jin (the masked singer), Yura (we got married), AOA's Jimin (Unpretty Rapstar), Choa (My Little Television), and Seolhyun (Orange Marmalade) have been around for a year. He is counted as a member of the girl group who showed outstanding performance. AOA will release a new song next month on the 22nd, and Girl's Day and Apink.\"\n",

    "politics_reference_translation=[\"In the by-elections on April 7, the People Power Party swept a victory in all districts north and south of the Han River, and won a whopping 80-90% of the votes in Gangnam. Experts believe voters responded sensitively to the issue of real estate taxes. Democratic Party of Korea candidate Park Young-sun only won in five of the 425 dongs in Seoul, showing that regardless of the district, Gangnam (south) or Gangbuk (north), citizens throughout the city had a strong desire to judge the ruling party. According to the final outcome of the Seoul mayoral election released by the National Election Commission on April 8, Oh seized the majority of the votes in 375 out of the total 425 dongs in Seoul. The surge of votes in Gangnam also intensified. Gangnam, Seocho, and Songpa were the top three autonomous districts where Oh received the most votes. Oh won 73.54% of the votes, more than three-fold the votes earned by Park (24.32%). Even within Gangnam-gu, the opposition party candidate received more votes in areas where redevelopment and reconstruction of apartment complexes and the tax burden due to rising official real estate prices were an issue. In Apgujeong-dong, Daechi 1-dong, Dogok 2-dong, and Banpo 2-dong, Oh received more than 80% of the votes. In the case of the Apgujeong-dong Polling Station 1, where the majority of the Apgujeong Hyundai Apartment residents vote, Oh earned 93.8% of the votes. Meanwhile, Nonhyeon 1-dong and Yeoksam 1-dong, where residences for young people, such as small apartment buildings referred to as villas in Korea and multiplex houses, are located, the People Power Party secured less than 70% of the votes, despite that these areas are also in Gangnam-gu. This is why experts believe the regulations on expensive apartments caused the public to turn away from the ruling party and pour their votes onto the opposition. During the election campaign, the People Power Party attacked the ruling party’s real estate regulations and stressed quick redevelopment and reconstruction. Voters living in areas where expensive apartments are located preferred the conservative party in the last parliamentary elections when the ruling party won a landslide victory, so experts point out that this wasn’t unique to the latest by-election. They argued that the latest victory by the opposition party was possible because the moderates and conservatives came together due to the frustration with the government’s real estate policies and the desire for judgment on the government. Park Young-sun enjoyed a slight lead over Oh in only five of the 425 dongs in Seoul--Seongsan 1-dong, Mapo-gu; Hwagok 8-dong, Gangseo-gu; Guro 3-dong, Guro-gu; Hang-dong, Guro-gu; Changsin 2-dong, Jongno-gu. Cho Jin-man, a professor at Duksung Women’s University said, The three districts in Gangnam are a conservative stronghold and interests, such as taxes, were strongly reflected here. He explained, After last year’s parliamentary election, there was the incident of former justice minister Cho Kuk and the LH scandal, which led many moderates and independent voters to think of judgment on the government and head out to the polling booth. Some experts argued that the ruling party’s attitude in accusing the Gangnam area of “real estate irregularities” also encouraged voters in Gangnam to turn away from the ruling party. Hong Hyung-sik, director of Hangil Research said, If speculation was a problem, all they had to do was solve the problem by catching the people engaging in speculation. But they chose a mechanism that blamed the people in Gangnam, enraging the people, regardless of whether they were progressive or conservative. He argued, We can’t say that they displayed the true nature of conservatives, but the opposition against accusations of bad practices was fierce.\"]\n",

However, only five of the 425 dongs in Seoul won the Democratic Party candidate Park Young-seon in this election, and it is interpreted that the theory of regime judgment was strongly influenced regardless of the distinction between Gangnam and North Korea. Looking at the final votes of the Seoul Mayor's election, which was compiled by the Central Election Commission on the 8th, it was found that Mayor Oh won a majority of the votes in 375 dongs out of 425 dongs in Seoul. The Gangnam Mall Pyo phenomenon has also intensified. Gangnam, Seocho, and Songpa-gu were the top three autonomous districts with the most votes by Mayor Oh. In Gangnam-gu, Mayor Oh's vote was 73.54%, more than three times that of Candidate Park (24.32%). Even within Gangnam-gu, the opposition party's approval rate was high in areas where apartment reconstruction and redevelopment or the detailed wall due to the increase in publicly announced land prices have emerged as a pending issue. In Apgujeong-dong, Daechi 1-dong, Dogok 2-dong, Banpo 2-dong, etc., Mayor Oh ranked the top with 80% of the votes. In the case of Apgujeong-dong No. 1 polling place, where a large number of Apgujeong Hyundai Apartment residents participated, Mayor Oh's vote reached 93.8%. On the other hand, in Gangnam-gu, Nonhyeon 1-dong and Yeoksam 1-dong, where there are many residences for young people such as villas and studios, the power of the people was in the 60% range. This is the background of the analysis that the public sentiment caused by the regulation of expensive apartments was not leading the confusion phenomenon. The power of the people attacked the ruling party's real estate regulations during the election process and emphasized rapid redevelopment and reconstruction. It is pointed out that the preference of the conservative party in the high-priced apartment area is not unique to this election, as it appeared in the last general election, when the passport won a lot. The opposition's great victory should be seen as a result of dissatisfaction with the real estate policy and the consolidation of the middle and conservative groups according to the theory of government judgment. Candidate Park slightly beat Mayor Oh in only five of the 425 dongs in Seoul (Seongsan 1-dong, Mapo-gu, Hwagok 8-dong, Gangseo-gu, Guro 3-dong, Guro-gu, Hang-dong, Guro-gu, and Changsin 2-dong, Jongno-gu). Professor Cho Jin-man of Duksung Women's University said, Gangnam 3 districts are a strong source of conservatives and interests such as taxes are strongly reflected. While doing so, the majority of the middle and shamans came to the polls,” he explained. Some interpreted that the attitude of the passport, which drove the Gangnam area as real estate abuse, also had an effect on the background of Ivan's public sentiment in the Gangnam area. If speculation is a problem, Hyung Hyung Hyung, head of Hangil Research, said, If speculation is a problem, we can catch speculators and solve them, but they were angry after leaving progress and conservatives because they took advantage of the mechanism that takes the responsibility of the Gangnam people. , The backlash against being driven by enemy obstruction is great.\"\n",
    "politics_naver_translation=\"With the people's power dominating the entire Gangnam and North regions in the April 7 Seoul mayoral by-election, a mole vote of 80 to 90 percent in Gangnam was poured into the people's power. It is interpreted that real estate tax issues have acted sensitively. However, Park Young-sun of the Democratic Party of Korea won only five out of 425 districts in Seoul in this election, which is interpreted as a strong theory of regime judgment, regardless of whether Gangnam or North Korea is distinguished. According to the final vote percentage of the Seoul mayoral election, which was finalized by the National Election Commission on the 8th, Mayor Oh won a majority of the votes in 375 out of 425 districts in Seoul. The number of votes cast in Gangnam has also intensified. Gangnam, Seocho, and Songpa-gu were the top three autonomous districts where Mayor Oh received the most votes. Mayor Oh won 73.54 percent of the vote in Gangnam-gu, more than three times Park's 24.32 percent. In Gangnam-gu, the opposition party's approval rating was also high in areas where the burden of reconstruction and redevelopment of apartments or the increase in official land prices has emerged as an issue. In Apgujeong-dong, Daechi 1-dong, Dogok 2-dong, and Banpo 2-dong, Oh won the top 80 percent of the vote. Mayor Oh received 93.8 percent of the vote at the first polling station in Apgujeong-dong, where many residents of Apgujeong Hyundai Apartment participated. On the other hand, the power of the people in Nonhyeon 1-dong and Yeoksam 1-dong, which are located in Gangnam-gu but have many young people such as villas and studio apartments, recorded 60 percent. Analysts say that public sentiment under the regulation of high-priced apartments may have led the phenomenon of voting. The people's power attacked the ruling party's real estate regulations during the election process and emphasized rapid redevelopment and reconstruction. Some point out that the preference for conservative parties in expensive apartment areas is not unique to this election, as it also appeared in the last general election, in which the ruling party won a huge victory. The opposition party's great victory should be attributed to complaints about real estate policies and the gathering of middle and conservatives based on the theory of regime judgment. Park narrowly beat Oh in only five out of 425 districts in Seoul (Seongsan 1-dong, Gangseo-gu, Hwagok 8-dong, Guro-gu, Hang-dong, Guro-gu, and Changshin 2-dong, Jongno-gu). Cho Jin-man, a professor at Duksung Women's University, said, The three districts in Gangnam are conservative and strongly reflect the interests of taxes. Since last year's general elections, many middle and independent people have come to the polls. Some interpreted that the ruling party's attitude, which drove the Gangnam area as real estate deep-rooted evil, also affected the background of public sentiment in the Gangnam area. Hong Hyung-sik, director of Hangil Research, said, If speculation is a problem, we can catch and solve speculators, but we are angry regardless of progressive and conservative because we used the mechanism to blame Gangnam people.\"\n"

This will make it inevitable for South Korea to face possible disruptions to its second quarter vaccination plan, since 67% of the vaccines were supposed to be from AstraZeneca. In a press briefing via video conferencing on April 7 (local time), the EMA announced that the EMA’s safety committee (PRAC) discovered a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, such as blood clots occurring in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, CVST), and said, the committee took into consideration all currently available evidence. This day, the government announced that it would postpone plans to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine to special education, daycare and health teachers and nursing staff at day care centers, scheduled to begin on April 8, and to the staff and people in facilities for the disabled, group homes for the elderly, shelters for people with tuberculosis and Hansen’s disease, homeless shelters, and correctional facilities, scheduled to begin on April 9. At present, authorities have also suspended the vaccination of people younger than sixty who were to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. The vaccination of over 180,000 people have been paused or postponed.

This is the highest figure in 89 days, since the third wave of the novel coronavirus began to stabilize on January 8 (674 cases). According to a regional analysis, 63.2% of the cases were in the greater Seoul area, and 36.8% were from outside the Seoul metropolitan area, clearly showing that the virus is spreading nationwide. The disease control authorities announced, The likelihood of a fourth wave is gradually increasing. Experts said, The fourth wave has already begun. Eom Joong-sik, a professor of infectious diseases at Gachon University Gil Medical Center said, The virus has begun to spread faster at a time when more than 300 cases are confirmed everyday. So it is likely for us to see a higher average of positive cases and for the wave to last longer. Raising the level of physical (social) distancing (currently level 2 in the greater Seoul area, and 1.5 in other areas) beginning next week seems inevitable. The key indicator for adjusting the level of distancing is the daily average number of locally transmitted cases, which recorded 523.7 in the past week, which already exceeded the standard for level 2.5 distancing (400-500 or more cases nationwide).\"]\n",

The ministry analyzed the court rulings of 2,753 criminals whose personal information was registered after they were convicted of sex crimes against minors in 2019. In 2019, 266 criminals committed digital sex crimes against minors, such as the production of sexually explicit content and the shooting of illegal videos.
